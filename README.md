# IPL Score Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This project focuses on predicting the score of an IPL cricket match using various machine learning algorithms. It leverages historical match data to make predictions about the final score for upcoming matches.

# Overview
IPL Score Prediction aims to provide cricket enthusiasts and sports analysts with a tool that can estimate the total score a team is likely to achieve in an IPL match based on various factors such as team performance, pitch conditions, player statistics, and more. The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

# Features
Utilizes historical IPL match data, including team performance, player statistics, and pitch conditions.
Implements different machine learning algorithms to make score predictions.
Provides a flexible and scalable framework for analyzing and predicting scores for future matches.

# Installation
Make sure to install the required Python libraries and dependencies by running the following commands:


pip install pandas

pip install numpy

pip install scikit-learn

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install jupyter

pip install flask


# Getting Started
To start working with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/jmdharshana/IPL-score-PRediction
Navigate to the project directory:cd ipl-score-prediction
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository to explore data, train models, and make predictions.

You can also deploy the model as a web application using Flask for real-time score predictions.

# Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing historical IPL match data, including team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, and match outcomes. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating machine learning models.

# Algorithms

The project explores various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to build predictive models. Each algorithm is evaluated for its accuracy in predicting IPL scores.

# Model Evaluation

The performance of each machine learning algorithm is assessed using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared value (R2). These metrics help to determine the accuracy of score predictions.

# Web Application

The project provides the option to deploy the best-performing model as a web application using Flask. Users can input match-related information, and the application will provide a score prediction based on the chosen model.
